## mlb odds

basically just finding probability that favored team in mlb matchup wins by only one run. the thinking is that a higher percentage indicates a better value bet. this is only "value" if you believe that the favorite should win by more than one run. i would like to do more with this idea, but i am having trouble finding good odds/scores apis that arent paid

requirements: python, python requests library
